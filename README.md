The first set of challenges is called “Bandit“, and it’s more of an introduction to the Linux CLI than anything else, and the objective of each level is to find the password to proceed to the next level.

The follwing content is a comprehensive write-up of my solutions for this challenge (Level 0 - 15). I advise you do it yourself before looking at the solutions as you won’t learn anything without trying. My goal here is simply to show you how I did it and compare your solutions with mine.

## Bandit Level 0
Definitely, level 0 is a giveaway to get you started with the actual challenges.
